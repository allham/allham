HTML(HyperTextMarkupLanguage) i s a code used to structure a web page and its content.
Consists of series of 'elements' which encloses(wrap) parts of content.
Anatomy of an 'element':
    - opening tag (name of the element wrapped in angle brackets)
    - content (text ...)
    - closing tag(angle brackets with a forward slash)
    an example '<p>My cat is very grumpy</p>' 
Elements can have attributes:
    '<p class="my-cat">My cat is very grumpy</p>'
    'class' is the attribute name, and 
    'my-cat' is  the attribute value.
Nesting elements:
    '<p>My cat is<strong>very</strong> grumpy.<p/>';
    'strong' element is nested in the 'p' element.
Void elements:
    elements that have no content  and have no closing tag('img').

Anatomy of an HTML document:
    " 
        <DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang='en'>
            <head>
                <meta>
                <title>Document</title>
                <link rel='stylesheet' href='style.css'>
            </head?
            <body>
            <img src="images/img.png" alt="some old picture">
            </body>
        </html>
    "

    '<DOCTYPE html>' is declaration meaning that we use 'HTML5' version of HTML.
    '<html> element wraps whole content of the page.
    '<head>' element is a container for staff that is not showed on the page itself;
    includes keywords, name of  the author , css style, links, character set;
    '<meta>' , ,<title>', '<link>'...
    '<body>' element  contains all the content that visitors to the page can see:
        text, images, videos ...
            Images are displayed in the page using  the '<img>' element
            with 'src' attribute:
    '<img src="path to the image" alt="explanatory text">'

        Marking up text
    Headings ('<h1>, <h2>,... <h6>)
    Comments , the browser ignores comments as it renders the code
        ('<!__ comment __>')
    Paragraphs ('<p>) elements contains paragraphs of text.
    Lists; there are two types : 'ordered'('ol>') and 'unordered'('<ul>');
        each item inside list is wraped in the '<li>' element.
        example:
        " 
        <ul>
            <li>'one'<li>
            <li>'two'<li>
        <ul>
        "
    links
        To add link we use '<a>' element , 'a' is short for 'anchor',
        and adding an 'href' attribute(it stands for 'hypertext reference')
